        <p>Internship at Paul Tech Software Services [2 months]</p>
      </div>
      <div class="education-place-description">
        <p>I had the opportunity to complete an internship at Paul Tech Software Services in Jamshedpur, where I gained valuable hands-on experience in the field of web development and software solutions. During my time there, I was introduced to real-world projects and worked alongside experienced developers, which helped me understand how professional software teams operate. I learned about project workflows, coding standards, and the importance of collaboration in delivering efficient and user-friendly applications.
          <br>
        This internship significantly boosted my technical skills, especially in front-end development and responsive design. I was involved in tasks such as coding web pages, testing features, and assisting in debugging issues, all under the guidance of my mentors. The experience not only enhanced my practical knowledge but also gave me insight into client requirements and how to meet them effectively. It was a valuable step in my journey toward becoming a skilled and confident web developer.</p>
