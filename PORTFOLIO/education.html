      <div class="education-place-description">
        <p>I completed my schooling at River View English School, where I built a strong academic foundation and developed essential skills in communication, critical thinking, and discipline. The school provided a well-rounded environment that supported both academics and extracurricular activities, helping me grow not just as a student, but as an individual. The supportive teachers and structured learning approach played a key role in shaping my interest in technology and design.
          <br>
          <br>
        In my 10th board examinations, I achieved an impressive 87.2%, reflecting my dedication and consistent hard work. This result stands as a proud milestone in my academic journey and motivates me to aim even higher in my future studies and career. My performance also demonstrates my ability to balance multiple subjects effectively and perform well under pressure.</p>

        <p>I am currently pursuing my diploma at Al-Kabir Polytechnic, a well-regarded institution known for its focus on technical education and hands-on learning. The college provides a strong academic environment with experienced faculty, modern labs, and industry-relevant coursework that helps students build practical skills. Being surrounded by motivated peers and supportive instructors has greatly enhanced my understanding of core subjects related to my field.
        <br>
        I am now in my second year, and the journey so far has been both challenging and rewarding. Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on projects, participate in workshops, and develop a deeper interest in web design and development.
        <br> My time at Al-Kabir Polytechnic is helping me grow not only as a student but also as a future professional, preparing me to take on real-world challenges with confidence and creativity.</p>
